LM Minutes for 26 March 
===

1. Updates from Alan on Covid-19 related issues.
2. Jack's turn to present data flow and infrastructure
    * May and Gordon will work on an API to pull data from existing database.
    * The tools should be open-sources, API-enabled and modular.
    * There are other future prospects of the infrastructure, such as reproducibility, ease of use, continuous model 
    deployment etc. 
    * Most promising platform MLflow and Kedro
3. MLflow
    * API available for MLflow (Python API) to pull out results
    * Not  modular - train-retain-depoly happended in one single block. 
    * Adaptation to other modules may be difficult to handle. 
    * If API is available, we might be able to build custom made python scripts for other modules (like monitoring).
4. Kedro
    * Good Visualisation - flowchart available
    * Modular, different blocks available
    * Possible to use Kedro and MLflow together.
5. Both tools are useful in some ways, maybe helpful to incorporate into LM infrastructure.
    * Janetta will work on infrastructure. 
6. Mahed and Gordon are working together on a publication that could be a research project from LM.
    
7. Next meeting will be chaired by either Mahed or Janetta.
