# Mapping SEER Features

This is my first attempt at matching the fields in the file Mahed has access to (used for the "Deep Multi-task Gaussian Processes for Survival Analysis with Competing Risks" and/or "Multitask Boosting for Survival Analysis with Competing Risks" papers) to columns in the actual SEER data.

The papers mention using data of around 70,000 breast cancer patients between 1992 and 2007. I looked at thw papers and the [SEER data dictionary/description](https://seer.cancer.gov/data-software/documentation/seerstat/nov2019/) to have a best guess at where each of the values in "Mahed's" file originally came from.

Selecting all the fields below in SEER Stat I get around 700,000 breast cancer patients, both from SEER 1975-2017 and SEER 1992-2017 (which covers less time but includes more locations). Haven't yet explored the files in detail, but a few of the features look mostly blank in SEER 1975.
