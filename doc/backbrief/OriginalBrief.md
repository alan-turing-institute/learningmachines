A learning machine in health is a software system which 

1.  processes data on patients
2.  provides clinicians with augmented intelligence and records their treatment plans, and 
3. records treatment evaluations – _essentially a three phase system with feedback – the outcome of treatment plans becoming new ‘data’_. 

Such a ’machine’ will provide the basis of rapid and precision diagnosis and personalised medicine. This is a generic concept: the flow through the system can be of any entities for which there is an intervention that can be evaluated. 

Applications in health provide the most developed example and will be a key part of this project. Other applications will be explored – notably the flow of offenders through the criminal justice system.
